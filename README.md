# RunescapeTopDown
Overview
This project is a personal prototype inspired by the classic RuneScape camera and movement style. It features:

Top-down perspective

Click-to-move player controls

Rotating camera/world view to replicate RuneScapeâ€™s iconic navigation feel

Directional sprite animation based on movement

This started as a fun experiment to learn and practice key game development concepts in Godot, such as camera manipulation and character control. It is not a complete game, but a working proof-of-concept prototype.

Features
Smooth click-to-move controls

World rotation for dynamic camera angle changes

Player sprite direction changes according to movement direction

Simple environment placeholder for movement testing

Controls
Left-click anywhere to move the player character in that direction

Camera rotates with the world (auto or manual depending on your implementation)

Installation
Clone or download this repository

Open the project in Godot (version X.X recommended)

Run the main scene (res://Main.tscn or whatever your main scene path is)

How to Use / Test
Click on the game window to move the player character

Observe the sprite orientation changes as the character moves

See the camera/world rotation effect

Future Plans
Add NPCs and interactive objects

Implement combat and inventory systems

Expand the environment into a full map

Polish animations and UI
